# Build An Email Formik Form
## What's this project about?
This project is about creating an email formik form within a React App.

## How to Run: 
- Get sure you download four files:
   路  index.html
   路  index.js
   路  App.js
   路  App.css
- Notice that the index.html file is where your React app will be loaded inside the root element
- The App.js file is the main component of your React application. This is where most of the code goes
- Open a command line on your computer and run the command cd path/to/project/root , which allows you to point to the root folder of the starter files (note that path/to/project/root should be replaced with the actual path to the starter files)
- Within the same command-line window, run npm install to install all dependencies
- Once the command completes successfully, run npm start to start the application in your browser
  
## What's next?
Experiment by aapplying this kind of forms / React App to other use cases.
